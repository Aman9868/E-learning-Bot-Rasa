  ##################--------------Startup Canvas---------------##################
  utter_startup_canvas:

  - text: "The Startup Canvas summarises the most important elements of an organisation's business model
           and is especially useful for early stage startups to think through the different elements.
           The version of the canvas being used here is inspired by the Lean methodology version of the Business Model Canvas (BMC)."

  utter_startup_canvas_use_cases:
  - text: Investigate and map how ideas or solutions could be transformed into a holistic business model.
          Map current business models, identify gaps and opportunities (priorities), and outline interdependencies.
          Use the canvas as a dashboard to document each stage of evolution of the business model, and reflect on investments and results.

  utter_startup_canvas_limit:
  - text: The Startup Canvas tool is not a problem solving tool as such. It has limited capacity to answer what the ‚Äòright‚Äô model for a business is. It is best used as an evolving summary or dashboard.
  
  utter_startup_canvas_steps:
  - text: |
      STEP BY STEP
      Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the Startup Canvas. You'll notice the columns on the left have to do with internal activity, and the ones to the right, refer to external forces.
      Get started: As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your understanding of your customer segment or of the needs you are addressing through your business? Start with the side of the canvas you think you know better.
      Complete: Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas in the first go.
      Identify knowledge gaps and priorities: Once the worksheet is completed to the best of your knowledge, jot down the knowledge gaps and priorities under each section. These could be issues, opportunities, or just lack of information about a particular area.

  #######################------Ten types of innovtaion----------------##############
  utter_ten_types_of_innovation:
  - text: |
      The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm, Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations, and helps them look at innovation as a holistic activity that involves internal as well as customer facing investments. 
      Under each type of innovation, Doblin has suggested a few strategies and tactics to use as a starting point.
  utter_ten_types_of_innovation_use_cases:
  - text: |
      USE CASES
      Map the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation.
      Identify strengths and weaknesses with regard to innovation at an organisation.
      Identify new types of innovation that an organisation can consider.
  utter_ten_types_of_innovation_limitations:
  - text: |
      While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are a combination of the different types ‚Äî causing some initial confusion. 
      Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends that teams may need to scan and map.
  utter_ten_types_of_innovation_steps:
  - text: |
      Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the Ten Types of Innovation. Note down what you think is the biggest differentiator in terms of innovation for your business.
      Identify key innovations: At the level of Configuration, Offering, and Experience - begin by noting down what makes the business innovative currently. If you have thoughts on what could potentially be future innovations, note them down as well.
      Review the tactics: Read through the tactics under each type of innovation, using the ‚ÄòTactics Cheat Sheet‚Äô.
      Unpack the innovation: Next, for each type of innovation, note down what makes your business innovative currently. Follow that by noting down potential innovations to explore in the future.
      Review and brainstorm: Review the mapping of current and potential innovations. Make any necessary changes, and then brainstorm how potential innovations could be created.

      "Map goals for phases: Review the various phases of development (POC, MVP, Alpha, Beta, Launch). Start by discussing what goals, the team should set for itself. Go phase by phase, map goals through consensus.
      Map teams and effort: In the left-most column, identify the different teams, functional/discipline wise (like marketing, technology, design), and cross-functional/multidisciplinary (like a payments team may have individuals from technology, design, and partnership teams working together). For each team, write down expected activities under each. Estimate the kind of skills and the number of people required. This has to be a loose estimate at the beginning, becoming more concrete as the product or service offering evolves.
      Map resources: Some teams may want to additionally map a resourcing roadmap - financial, material, and technical resources that may be needed to achieve each phase.
      Map timelines: Add the different phases against expected timelines (in terms of weeks and months).
      Digitise and share: After completion, share your roadmap within your team, and with other stakeholders.
      Note: Use different colour sticky notes for goals, activities, resources, and timelines.""

      The SWOT tool is used to undertake an overarching analysis of a business, product, service or system. It accounts for both internal (Strengths and Weaknesses)
      and external (Opportunities and Threats) forces that impact strategy and decision making.
  utter_swot_analysis_steps:

##################-----------------------------Theory of Change-----------------------------#############################  
  utter_theory_of_change:
  - text: |
       Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework to map 'desired change' against input activities and investments. 
       It helps innovators build relevant strategies for change by differentiating between results and impact. 
       The framework also helps link long term and short-term goals, creating a logical flow that can be used to guide efforts
       The TOC is especially relevant to social businesses, and development sector organisations, because impact is critical.
       However, business sector organisations may also use it to consider their own ability to create impact.
       Product Roadmap and Activity Plan can be used to inform the TOC exercise and vice versa.

       Unpack the necessary resources: First fill in the left side of the tool to list the basic financial, people and material resources needed (or available) to roll out the programme.\n
       List down activities that these resources would help carry out. A team may choose to start with activities first, and then list resources (in case it is a proposal to raise resources).\n
       Link efforts to impact: Link resources and activities to outputs (short-term) and outcomes (long-term) that together represent long-term impact.\n
       List assumptions: Review the template and call out assumptions you may be making at each step. Discuss what these assumptions are, and what could be done to counter them."

      "Select takeaways: Refer back to key themes and learnings (the takeaways) from Affinity Mapping or any other exercise done by the team for the first level of synthesis. Select the most important takeaways.
       Reflect on takeaways: Once the takeaways have been selected, map them on the left most column. Then, for individual takeaways and for groups of takeaways, discuss what they mean for the design process.
       Write down insights: As individuals first, and then as a team, write down insights based on the discussion. Insights are new and/or fundamental things one has understood, about the problem and potential solutions.
       Expand into opportunities: To ease the transition into problem solving, frame some early opportunities as How Might We statements (see Design Challenge tool)."

      "Personas are one of the most important tools within the world of human centered design. They are fictional ‚Äòcharacters‚Äô that represent a type of user or stakeholder for whom a solution has to be developed. A Persona is not a single demographic segment of users, but instead an archetype of a certain type of need, behaviour, and motivation, that may represent multiple people across demographic segments. Instead of designing for broad, anonymous segments, Personas help focus on real people and needs."

  utter_personas_process:
  - text: |
      "Find patterns: Based on research data, identify patterns emerging with regard to the types of users. These patterns are based on commonalities of needs, behaviours, and motivations.
       Define persona: For a chosen type of user, list specific behaviours, motivators, and pain points.
       Illustrate persona: Visualise a user type as a single individual that will serve as the representative face and voice of the type. Visuals need not be perfect.
       Build more personas: Personas can be created for as many user types as the team feels necessary to consider for design."

       Map the experience: Go through each step of the journey and map interactions and touch-points that are key to the experience. Next, based on the information gathered from users, map positive and negative experiences through the course of the journey. If imagining a new journey, map what is intended at each step.
       Identify opportunities: Discuss how positive experiences can be elevated, and negative experiences addressed, at each stage of the experience."
